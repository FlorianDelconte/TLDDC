## TLDDC
<!--This code use a previous work (https://github.com/vanthonguyen/treelogdefectsegmentation). The previous work first compute a centerline from a tree mesh (by accumulation in 3D voxels) then an estimation of the surface radius is done by the studies of rectangular patch around vertices mesh. This allows the computation of delta distance for each vertices. Finally a treshold  (Rosin) is compute to distinguish wich vertices is a part of defect or not. To know more about the previous work, there is an online demo : http://ipol-geometry.loria.fr/~kerautre/ipol_demo/TDD_IPOLDemo/ and there is an article :  ICPR 2016 "Segmentation of defects on log surface from terrestrial Lidar data".

Here, we want to explore an other use of the centerline. The main idea, is using centerline to unroll tree mesh, then work on 2D image with an intensity able to represent defect shape. This image may be usefull to labeling task, segmentation task, and clasification task. -->
Repository of work submitted to ICPR 2020:

**Tree Defect Segmentation usingGeometric Features and CNN**

the run of the methods can be done without any installation with this online demonstration [here](http://kerautret.github.io/TLDDC)

Roughly speaking, we first unroll the mesh thanks to the center line log. Then, we compute defect segmentation with an CNN. Below, there is an illustration of the pipeline of the project.

###### DGtal version 0.9. To install DGtal see [DGtal installation] (https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/blob/master/README.md)
###### PCL version 1.7 or later
###### Eigen3
###### GNU GSL
###### CMake 2.6 or later
###### OPENCV

## Install
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..  -DDGtal_DIR=/path/to/DGtal
make
```
